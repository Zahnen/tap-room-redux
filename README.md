_Hopper is a React-based inventory management tool. Hopper allows users to track stock of kegs of beer and adjust their inventory as needed in a single-page application. Hopper was created as an independent project while studying at Epicodus. The application was created to apply concepts I learned this week which include the fundementals of React, modifying shared & local state, use of PropTypes._
